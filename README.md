Hello, My name is Chris, I'm a 33 year old branch manager at local credit union in SF and am new to programming. I mostly want to explore programming because it was something that I wanted to learn how to do as a kid but never pursued it. I got into the world of financial institutions and kept working my way up from being a teller to a manager. Through hard work and peserverance, I am where I am today but as I've gotten older, I'm starting to realize that I don't think I truly love what I do. I'm hoping my exploration into programming might lead me down a different path or at least help me create a better work/life balance.
